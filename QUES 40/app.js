// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
// The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
// Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
function make_album(artist, title, tracks) {
    var album = {
        artist: artist,
        title: title
    };
    if (tracks) {
        album.tracks = tracks;
    }
    return album;
}
